# songgles (sonar goggles)
A project to hopefully help my recently gone blind dog (Navi) stop running into things. It's basically a backup sensor that I plan to install on her face somewhere.

## hardware:
- sonar
- beeper
- programmer

## install:
- libusb-devel // required by stm8flash
- sdcc // required to build for stm8

## run:
- make init // get stm8flash and build it
- make // build the songles program
- make flash // flash the songles program
